__What is screenrec?__

screenrec is a little utility to take a screenshot of your desktop screen and in
the future also record a video of it.  Contrary to other popular programs, it
reads directly from the framebuffer of your Linux kernel DRM subsystem,
bypassing the X server or Wayland, so in theory it may achieve better
performance.  Other programs have attempted this strategy, for example ffmpeg
with the kmsgrab device, and there were some attempts to include this feature in
OBS.



__How do I use it?__

You can build the program with a simple 'make'; the only dependency is libdrm.

To take a screenshot of your screen, run

 $ screenrec -s > output.ppm

screenrec will take a screenshot and output the result to standard output in
binary PPM format so you can redirect it as in the example.  For this
proof-of-concept I use PPM which is a very basic format that has decent support
in popular programs.  Note that screenrec needs root privilege or at least the
correct capabilities to access the framebuffer.

screenrec will query the first plane of the first framebuffer of the first crtc
of the first video card. This will be the right choice in many cases.  The
cursor will not be recorded, since it is usually put in a different plane.

At present screenrec is a test for my system and so it supports either a
4kb-tiled framebuffer or a linear one and the pixel format XR24, but this is
easy to expand.

You can run "screenrec -d" to dump info about your DRM setup so you can check
those assumptions.  Look at the pixel_format and modifier fields and compare
them against include/uapi/drm/drm_fourcc.h in the Linux source tree.
