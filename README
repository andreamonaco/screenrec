__What is screenrec?__

screenrec is a little utility to take a screenshot of your desktop screen and
record a video of it.  Contrary to other popular programs, it reads directly
from the framebuffer of your Linux kernel DRM subsystem, bypassing the X server
or Wayland, so in theory it may achieve better performance.  Other programs have
attempted this strategy, for example ffmpeg with the kmsgrab device, and there
were some attempts to include this feature in OBS.



__How do I use it?__

You can build the program with a simple 'make'; screenrec depends on libdrm for
querying DRM setup and on libx264 for video encoding; if you use a distribution
with packages, you probably need the 'dev' version of these libraries for
building.

To take a screenshot of your screen, run

 $ screenrec -s > output.ppm

screenrec will take a screenshot and output the result to standard output in
binary PPM format so you can redirect it as in the example.  For this
proof-of-concept I use PPM which is a very basic format that has decent support
in popular programs.

To record your screen (without audio), use

 $ screenrec -r -o output.mkv

the output will be saved in the file specified by the -o option; if a file with
that name exists, it will be overwritten.

screenrec will use the Matroska container and H.264 codec.  The recording will
be at the native refresh rate, see the -y option to change that.  Press ENTER to
stop recording.

Note that in both cases screenrec needs root privilege or at least the correct
capabilities to access the framebuffer.

screenrec will query the first plane of the first framebuffer of the first crtc
of the first video card. This will be the right choice in many cases.  The
cursor will not be recorded, since it is usually put in a different plane.

At present screenrec is a test for my system and so for screenshots it supports
either a 4kb-tiled framebuffer or a linear one and the pixel format XR24, while
for recording it only supports 4kb-tiled order and XR24 format; these limitation
are easy to expand.

You can run "screenrec -d" to dump info about your DRM setup so you can check
those assumptions.  Look at the pixel_format and modifier fields and compare
them against include/uapi/drm/drm_fourcc.h in the Linux source tree.



__Does screenrec use the GPU in any way?__

At present, it doesn't.  This matches my needs: my laptop has an old video card,
so using hardware-accelerated encoding means choking the video card while
paradoxically leaving the CPU under-used.
If you have other needs or suggestions, write to me!
